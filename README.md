Review

Sign on to a reasonable deal and then watch your monthly rent increase LIKE CRAZY. They are banking on the fact that you won't make the effort to move your stuff to another facility. Also, I signed up for auto-pay and naturally, the credit cards eventually expire. They are merciless about giving you a 25% late fee and wont budge on reversing the charge. Ridiculous, unethical & unscrupulous.

Roller coaster.... Good!!!!    In fact, amazing.

Location of said roller coaster... Even more fabulous.

Location of hotel... Not so good.  Especially when you've dressed nice with your lady pals and head on out to the strip.  3 hours later and 30 propositions from strange weirdos later, we finally made it to Caesars palace.  

Although I had a great time next time I'd book a place closer to wherever the action is (bellagio, Caesars palace).  The upside is it does have free parking below!!

PRO: staff was friendly.

CONS: Dog got sick from here.  Sneezing and difficulty breathing, which the dog has NEVER had.

At $50/day, I think they can do better with their strict warranty.

The pricing was not explained clearly and what we thought was $25/day turned out to be $50/day.

Review

I have three dogs and three cats, and I am very particular about their care.  In 10 years living in Atlanta I never found a vet I was truly happy with.  

Upon moving to Charlotte, I am thrilled to have found Atrium Animal Clinic.  My pets have been seen by three of their vets, based on my pets' particular need and the doctors' specialties, and I have been very happy with all of them, both from their medical expertise and bedside manner/demeanor.  The entire staff is always pleasant and friendly to me and my pets.  I love that they offer both holistic and traditional options.  My preference is for a more holistic approach, but I like that the traditional options are available if needed.

I cannot imagine taking my pets anywhere else and am so grateful to have found this clinic.
